#Reflection on GPS 1.1

1. The Git concept that I struggled with the most prior to the session was definitely merge conflicts. I did not fully understand what circumstances caused a confict or how to fix them.

2. John did a great job of introducing us to git fetch and git git origin/branchname. I had no prior knowledge about the use of these commands prior, and I now understand why that may be a better course of action a good portion of the time while updating our local repos. He also introduced us to --help, which will be very relevant in the future. Merge conflicts were also very much clarified for me (in release 5). The little picture specifically explaining in lamense terms what a merge confict looks like helped my understanding greatly. 

3. I asked about certain situations that could bring about a merge conflict (such as creating one on my own), as well as a question about a more specific explanation of the purpose of using git fetch/merge rather than git pull.

4. The difference between git fetch/merge and git pull is still a bit fuzzy for me because it is new, I will need to play around with the commands in my practice repos in order to see the immediate effects. Seeing the size of just the "add" --help within git also let me know that there is a ton left to get confused about. 

5. I had an awesome experience pairing. John was very helpful when he needed to be and let us sink a little bit when we needed to before jumping in to clarify something. Jorge was great and clearly showed a determination to help me understand and complete the required releases. I was nervous going in (have a bit of an introverted tendancy), but quickly warmed up and appreciated the alternate form of learning compared to what I am used to.
