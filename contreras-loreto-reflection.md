**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
I was struggling mostly on the workflow related to how to continuously update the local repository with the remote repository.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
*Cloning*, since for some reason I confused it a little with a common pull to update your repository.
*Origin*, as being the default name for gitHubs master branch.
*Fetch*, which was unknown to me and how it is a way of reviewing the files that were changed without doing the merge until it is commanded.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
I asked them whether they delete or keep the local branches they make, as well as what other version control systems exist, and clarification on what is the proper way of updating a local file.


**What still confuses you about Git?**
The entire workflow... every time I feel like I understand it, a new variable/concept that is unknown to me comes up... I can only imagine this will happen often when a large team is working on the same repo as me.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
Great! My peer partner was awesome and very friendly, although I still feel "stage fright" when people see what I am doing on my computer and feel like I can't think clearly!
